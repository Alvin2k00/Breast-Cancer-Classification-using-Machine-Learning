Different algorithms were tested to accommodate the model, and different metrics were calculated. The dataset was split into train and test data, then the training data was 
trained and test data was used for calculating the metrics. 
These all values were tabulated it is shown below, and it turns out that SVM gave the best accuracy.

It gave the accuracy of 99.12 %. If we take a look at the False positives and False negatives they were  zero and one respectively.
